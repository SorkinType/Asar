# Asar (was Ekta)

Asar is a design that is based on an expanding brush stroke following a heart line. 

The design is meant to be for long texts but have a certain charm at large sizes.

Asar is based off the OpenType features found in Pria Ravichadran's Palanquin font. 

Initially the design's widths are heart lines also come from interpreting Palanquin. 

Deviations from Palanquin's structure have begun to appear when the density of the brush strokes dictate wider spacing. 

The brush used to stroke the hartline comes from the bush tracing option in the expand path feature found in Fontlab Studio. The settings used are Width: 93, Angle: -55, and Roundness: 35.

In general the solutions offered are focused on designing the paths so that the brush stoking the path works. Where this is not satisfying manual adjustments will be made.

This is version 1.0

The next version will have more I matra widths and will proably change the structure of some conjuncts and perhaps add a few as well.
